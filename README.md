This crate's entire purpose is to seed the
[libellis](https://github.com/libellis/libellis-backend) database with fake data (generated by
[faker](https://github.com/tikotzky/faker-rs) library).

### Setup

You MUST set a `PSQL_URL` environment variable to your libellis postgres database.

#### Example
```terminal
$ export PSQL_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost/
```

Note the ending forward slash in the example above is **required**. You can optionally set this in a `.env` file in the root folder of this project if you are
running the project from a local folder.

### Installation

You may install this in one of two ways. If you have `cargo` installed then it's very easy. If
not, you can install rust and cargo by following this very simple [cargo setup](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) process.
Once you have cargo installed you can install this terminal application by running:

```terminal
$ cargo install birdseed
```

Optionally you may instead clone this repo and in the root directory build the release version
of this crate:

```terminal
$ git clone https://github.com/libellis/birdseed.git
$ cd birdseed
$ cargo build --release
```

### Features

#### `feed`

You can seed all databases with the `feed` subcommand:

```terminal
$ birdseed feed
```

We can specify a row count (overriding the default of 1000 rows):

```terminal
$ birdseed feed -r 10000
```

In this exampe we override the default of 1,000 rows and instead seed 10,000 rows.

Note: What the row count really means is that we will seed row count amount of users, surveys
and questions, but row count * 4 amount of choices and votes.

### `setup`

You can setup the main libellis and libellis_test databases with this
subcommand.  It will attempt to drop both libellis and libellis_test before
creating them so be careful! Only use this if you don't need the data in your
libellis database and want to start over, or are creating your libellis databases for the first time.

```terminal
$ birdseed setup
```

#### `clear`

You can clear all tables with the `clear` subcommand:

```terminal
$ birdseed clear
```

#### `rebuild`

You can rebuild all tables according to embedded diesel migrations

```terminal
$ birdseed rebuild
```
